## 🙏 Project: Charity Foundation “Blagodeystvie”

The MVP was delivered within a tight timeframe (2.5 weeks) for the foundation’s important conference. The main goal was to create a modern, functional, and fast-loading website that effectively communicates the foundation’s mission and values to a broad audience.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Astro JS + Svelte — a lightweight, fast, and modern combination for building static sites with dynamic “islands.”
- **Backend:** WordPress — for convenient content management without writing PHP.
- **CSS:** TailwindCSS — for rapid and flexible styling.
- **Form Validation:** Felte with Zod-based validator — reliable and flexible form validation.
- **Swiper:** For user-friendly image carousels.
- **Main-screen map** created using SVG + Svelte.

## 🌐 Hosting and Deployment

The site was deployed on a rented Russian VPS using Dokploy — a platform that allows easy management of projects and server resources while providing full deployment freedom. The code is managed through the Russian cloud Git service, GitFlic.

## 🎯 Outcome

The website was successfully showcased at the conference, helping to raise awareness of the foundation’s work and attracting attention to their important mission. The project was later expanded to include several additional initiatives of the foundation.
