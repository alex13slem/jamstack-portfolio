## ðŸ“‹ Role in the Project

I fully implemented the entire project, including frontend and backend, except for the design. My work included building the website, integrating interactive elements, and setting up the server infrastructure.

## ðŸ’¼ Technologies

- [**Astro JS (SSG)**](https://astro.build/): Used for static site generation, ensuring high performance and fast page load times.
- [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/): Implemented interactive elements and islands on the site, enabling dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- [**Decap CMS**](https://decapcms.org/): Provided easy content management on the site, allowing the team to update and add new information effortlessly.
- [**Zod**](https://zod.dev/): Used for data validation, ensuring application reliability and security.
- [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/): The project was deployed on Netlify, including serverless functions for form submissions and Telegram integration.

## âœ¨ Features and Highlights

- **Content Management:** Fully managed via [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/), allowing the team to handle content easily.
- **Type Safety:** Decap CMS configuration is fully typed with TypeScript, ensuring high reliability and predictability in development.
- **Interactive Islands:** [Interactive Islands](https://docs.astro.build/ru/concepts/islands/) implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) provide dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Telegram Integration:** Forms on the site are integrated with Telegram through [Netlify serverless functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/), enabling quick and convenient communication with users.
- **Data Storage:** Data is stored not in a database but in [YAML](https://doka.guide/tools/yaml/) and [Markdown](https://doka.guide/tools/markdown/) files in the repository, simplifying management and versioning.

### ðŸ”‘ Advantages of Using YAML and Markdown Files

- **Simplicity and Transparency:** Data is stored in text format, making it easy to edit and read.
- **Versioning:** Storing data in the repository allows tracking changes with version control systems (like Git), making it easy to roll back and review the history of modifications.
- **Low Infrastructure Costs:** No need to set up and maintain complex databases, reducing infrastructure costs.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Easily integrates with continuous integration and deployment pipelines, allowing automatic updates to the site whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
